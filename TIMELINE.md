# 10-day build timeline

The proposal (`docs/` — original PDF, not committed) scopes this as an 8-week
project. This repo builds the same confirmatory family on a 10-day schedule:
each day below is one focused commit, reviewed before moving to the next.

| Day | Milestone | Proposal ref |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Research questions, analysis plan, treatment classification table (**done**) | Week 1 |
| 2 | Pull real FRED/QCEW data; source-check treatment table against DOL/NCSL; scaffold the CPS-ORG pull (**done**) | Week 2 |
| 3 | Exposure measure from CPS-ORG; QCEW correlation validation check; exposure-distribution check (**done**) | Week 2-3 |
| 4 | Simple linear regression (§7) and multiple regression (§6.1) (**done**) | Week 4 |
| 5 | Model A (binary DiD) and Model C (exposure interaction), both industries (**done**) | Week 5 |
| 7 | Event study / parallel-trends check; COVID-sensitivity covariate spec (**done**) | Week 6-7 |
| 8 | Placebo test; cluster bootstrap for β₄; model diagnostics (**done**) | Week 7 |
| 9 | Two-sample t-test; descriptive statistics; one-way regional ANOVA; Monte Carlo permutation (**done**) | Week 8 |
| 10 | Final R Markdown report, README pass, reproducibility check | Week 8 |

**Resolved:** the Day 2/3 IPUMS blocker is cleared — a real `IPUMS_API_KEY`
was set locally and the CPS-ORG pull ran for real (Day 3).

**Environment note:** the project moved from `~/Desktop` to `~/Projects`
partway through Day 3 after `~/Desktop`'s iCloud sync (full quota) started
corrupting `.git` objects mid-session. Recovered by re-cloning from GitHub
(which was current through the Day-2 commits) and re-copying the
not-yet-committed Day-3 files over individually with checksum verification.
No history or data was lost, but this is why the repo now lives outside
any iCloud-synced folder.

**Power analysis note:** Section 4.4 of the proposal pre-registers this
design as likely underpowered for the exposure-gradient question (β₄) — that
is expected, not a bug to chase, and the power simulation (folded into a
later day) exists to state that limit honestly rather than to "fix" it.
